# Regional LSTM on the GPU box

The clean tree-vs-LSTM comparison: identical 416 catchments, identical
1970–2010 / 2010–2022 temporal split, identical HadUK-Grid / Hydro-PE
forcings as `experiments/hgb_baseline.py`. The run produces one parquet of
test predictions that `experiments/evaluate.py` scores on the main machine —
so only that small file needs to travel back.

## Setup (Intel Arc 140T)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielthomascooper/flood && cd flood
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
# PyTorch with Intel XPU support (torch >= 2.5):
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
pip install pandas pyarrow scikit-learn
python -c "import torch; print(torch.xpu.is_available())"   # expect True
```

(NVIDIA box instead: plain `pip install torch` — the script auto-detects
cuda → xpu → cpu.)

## Data needed (~760 MiB, not the full 10.6 GiB)

Only two folders:

```
data/Catchment_Attributes/                                  (~1 MiB)
data/Catchment_Timeseries/hydro-meteorological/daily/       (754 MiB)
```

Either rsync them from the main machine:

```bash
rsync -a main-machine:~/source/flood/data/Catchment_Attributes ./data/
rsync -a main-machine:~/source/flood/data/Catchment_Timeseries/hydro-meteorological/daily \
      ./data/Catchment_Timeseries/hydro-meteorological/
```

or re-download with `aria2c -i urls-aria.txt -c -x4 -j8` after filtering
`urls-aria.txt` to those two path prefixes.

## Run

```bash
python experiments/lstm/train_lstm.py --out experiments/results
```

Defaults: 365-day sequences, hidden 128, batch 256, 8 epochs × 1500 batches
(~3M training sequences drawn from the 5.5M available). Checkpoints every
epoch to `experiments/results/lstm_checkpoint.pt`; rerunning the same
command resumes. Watch `val NSE(norm)` — it should climb past +0.6 within a
few epochs; if it plateaus early, add `--epochs 16`.

Rough expectations on an Arc 140T (16 GB): a few minutes per epoch, then
10–20 min of test inference — a coffee-length run end to end. If XPU memory
complains, drop `--batch 128`.

## Bring the result back

Copy these to the main machine's `experiments/results/`:

```
lstm_test_predictions.parquet    # gid / obs / pred, indexed by date
lstm_manifest.json               # config + split provenance
```

Then score it against the tree:

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "experiments")
import pandas as pd
from evaluate import evaluate, report
res = pd.read_parquet("experiments/results/lstm_test_predictions.parquet")
report([evaluate(res, "lstm")[0]])
```

The numbers to beat, from `experiments/results/`: median NSE +0.820
(tree, gauged), top-1% NSE −0.811, AMAX bias −17.4%. The interesting
question is not the headline NSE but whether learned state narrows the
flood-day gap the tree could not: top-1% NSE and AMAX bias are the columns
to watch.
